# biDream - A Dual-Personality Scripting Language

biDream is an exceptional scripting language that features two personas; Titan and DayDream. It offers precise, ordered code as well as artistic, abstract thinking which allows free-flowing creation. Each persona enables the coder either structure or emotion in their work.


Introduction

biDream, as the name suggests, is designed as a programming language; rather, it derives from a more abstract method of logic. Its unique combination of two modes allows for sheer flexibility alongside rigid structure.

Titan: the level-headed one, where strict and logical codes are dictated.

DayDream: the whimsical one, where anything goes.

With biDream, the user has the option to select their style based on their mood, emotions, or the job requirements.


## Features

- Symbolic: Declaim either Titan’s directives or DayDream’s vague statements.

- Illusive code: in a diabolic fashion, coding has emotions and feelings attached to it making the programmer’s interaction more than just a chore.

- Poetic math: write an equation that looks like poetry when in DayDream, or as math while in Titan.

- Flexibility: can easily switch caps and pseudonyms at their leisure.
